The motive behind the making of automated form filler is to show the flaw in google form ->

1. They sholud have options to add a captcha in the form 
2. The 4000 entries limit looses valid entries in the drive. (but they do have an option to download the entire data )

Google forms recieves a stepmotherly treatment from its own makers.
There is no option to add a custom theme (ok this is acceptable as they want to monetize over custom forms)
But non-availability of  capta support is unforgiveable.

Dont missuse this to  corrupt forms.


Usage - 

./formfiller2.py "googleformurl" "number of times to repeat"



formfiller.py doesnt use lxml so it can only fill textfields and textareas
formfiller2.py requires lxml
